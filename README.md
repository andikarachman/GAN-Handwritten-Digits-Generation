# Handwritten Digits Generation

In this notebook, we'll be building handwritten digits generation models. Two methods are used:
1. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
2. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

MNIST dataset will be used to train the models.

This project is inspired by one of the mini-projects in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
